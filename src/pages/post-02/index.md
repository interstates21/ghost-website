- There is no such thing as yourself. We’re a simple algorithm which receives information from the outsides and transforms into the narrative of ourselves. We are literally the content we follow, the people around us and the habits we have.
- Our behaviour is mostly a biochemistry, a mixture of hormones in our body. Basically, it’s very hard to control what do you feel, but you could make your environment more hormone-friendly.The most important thing for your happiness, intellect and success is control over your information field. 
- Most of the information is a noice.
- Social environment is critically important. You're probably in a bad one. That's likely a reason of your low self-esteem
- Everything is a habit. Most of the decisions are automatic. It’s much likely to pick up a shitty habit and in that case the time would work against your well-being.
- It’s very difficult to cultivate a good habit. It requires a great amount of conscious brain power, which you normally don’t have. The best way is to step-by-step create an easy and enjoyable playground for maintaining your habit ( keep your sport bag packed, room - clean and workspace - ready ).
- Sport is a corner stone habit. High pulse running gives me more testosterone than anything else.
- This world is so different from the one 5 years ago. We must consciously adapt to new conditions, track tendencies, be up to date. The most of the ’success’ stories don’t work anymore. For instance, the market has become much more strict to junior developers - they must know a lot of stuff and use tricks to draw attention of the recruiters.
- The world is getting more marketized … everywhere. Instagram fuels that. If you’re looking for a friend, a partner or come up with some weekend activity - you’ll be likely tested for the market price of your personality. 
- I don’t like a new society’s trend for promoting online life, moving the social connections online. It’s a reasonable way to keep safe during the pandemic but the online connections are indeed much weaker. It could be a big deal to be in one room with outstanding people (i.e Stanford Campus).
- Everyone has the same right for living in this world and occupying space.
- I like to look for simple habits I could build in order to evolve constantly. Like speaking English with everyone instead of Russian, switching from public transport to bicycle, combining my run trainings with stretching, buying bananas instead of sweets. There are a lot of quite good but not obvious substitutes for our everyday activities.
- Things may be infinitely good or infinitely bad it's just a matter of the internal and external design.
- Small wins are the most important confidence booster, though I struggle to design my small-win generator. As I’ve read yesterday: ’We must do a good job and form a great habits in order to stop identifying ourselves as losers.'
- It’s much harder that you think to find a related information and it requires a lot of time and surfing. It’s mostly a waste of time to dive into a content from people with a different background.
- Liberalism is fading out. It’s getting harder to distinguish an independent individual with values and thoughts in a post-modern world. 
- You indeed have to track somehow the direction of your life. Even if you thing you’re not a kind of person to stuck at a dead point, probably you’ll end up there.
- Vertical relations, hierarchy are miserable! Everywhere.
- Sometimes it’s hard to search for the truth and to be fair to everyone but we avoid responsibility not doing that.
- There are a lot of non-linear causalities we don’t see. Some decisions might be 1k times more profitable than others ( like choosing a profession ). Some tiny tiny factors might move your life in a certain direction.
-  We’re usually lazy to do a profound research about important choices but that’s what we have to do
- I think it’s right to consider life is a sequence of real-time decisions we’re fully responsible for. That’s what graceful relationships are all about. You're consciously making a choice for that person every point of time cause for you it’s better to stay together. Eventually, each value may be determined by our existential attitude about it. 
- A terrible amount of irony in social networks is sad.
- Abstract things can’t teach you anything! Though it might be beautiful in a certain way.
- Sometimes travelling is a bad idea
- Your life may be either valuable or not, depends on your decisions and beliefs.
- Your self esteem, consequantually your position in the social hierarchy depends on such tiny things as voice, speed of speach, straight back, hairstyle, your playlist, whatever in the present moment
- Friendship is a hard work
- If you’re doing mistakes and don't feel confident at the moment - think slower
- You usually move forward only in certain intensive moments. Those moments are usually inspired by new people, new environment or dopamine generators like sport.
