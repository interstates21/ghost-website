- The most important thing for your happiness, intellect and success is control over your information field. We’re a simple algorithm which receives information from the outsides and transforms into the narrative of ourselves. We are literally the content we follow, the people around us and the habits we have.
- Everything is a habit. Most of the decisions are automatic. It’s much likely to pick up a shitty habit and in that case the time would work against your well-being.
- It’s very difficult to cultivate a good habit. It requires a great amount of conscious brain power, which you normally don’t have. The best way is to step-by-step create an easy and enjoyable playground for maintaining your habit ( keep your sport bag packed, room - clean and workspace - ready ).
- Sport is a corner stone habit. High pulse running gives me more testosterone than anything else.
- This world is so different from the one 5 years ago. We must consciously adapt to new conditions, track tendencies, be up to date. The most of the ’success’ stories don’t work anymore. For instance, the market has become much more strict to junior developers - they must know a lot of stuff and use tricks to draw attention of the recruiters.
- The world is getting more marketized … everywhere. Instagram fuels that. If you’re looking for a friend, a partner or come up with some weekend activity - you’ll be likely tested for the market price of your personality. 
- I don’t like a new society’s trend for promoting online life, moving the social connections online. It’s a reasonable way to keep safe during the pandemic but the online connections are indeed much weaker. It could be a big deal to be in one room with outstanding people (i.e Stanford Campus).
- Everyone has the same right for living in this world and occupying the space.
- I like to hunt for a simple things I could do in order to evolve constantly. Like speaking English with everyone instead of Russian, switching from public transport to bicycle, combining my run trainings with stretching, buying bananas instead of sweets. 
- Small wins are the most important confidence booster, though I struggle to design my small-win generator.
- Some content ( i.e classic literature, articles of people from a different background ) cannot give you anything. It’s very hard to find a related content. American society is not indeed Ukrainian, programmers now are different from ones in 2010.
